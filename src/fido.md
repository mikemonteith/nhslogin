  <p>We are currently adding FIDO2 authentication to NHS login.</p>
  <p>You should avoid adding our existing biometric capabilities to your service as FIDO2 will replace this.</p>
</div>

<p class="nhsuk-body">FIDO2 will offer a secure method of authentication, allowing users to access NHS services by using biometrics, PIN, or security keys instead of traditional passwords.

If you're interested in adding FIDO2 authentication and would like to be involved in our testing, contact us via [Slack](https://nhs-login-support-slack-invite.herokuapp.com) or email <a href="mailto:engage.nhslogin@nhs.net">engage.nhslogin@nhs.net</a>.

You can find out more about how we use FIDO by reading the [external interface specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/interface-spec-doc/) (EIS). </p>
