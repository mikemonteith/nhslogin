title: Biometric FIDO Authentication
---

Partners interested in using biometric authentication for NHS login, will need a FIDO client that works with our FIDO server.

[NHS client code for Android](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhsapp-fido-client-android)

[NHS client code for iOS](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhsapp-fido-client-ios)

Partners can use this code to install their own client or reference it to create their own FIDO client.

Find out more about how we use FIDO by reading the [external interface specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/interface-spec-doc/) (EIS).
