  <p>We're in the process of adding FIDO2 authentication to NHS login for enhanced security and usability.</p>
  <p>During this transition, please refrain from implementing any FIDO authentication to your service until the work is complete.</p>
</div>

Partners interested in using biometric authentication for NHS login, should wait for the work to be carried out on our FIDO server.

FIDO2 will offer a secure method of authentication, allowing users to access NHS services by using biometrics, PIN, or security keys instead of traditional passwords. 

Find out more about how we use FIDO by reading the [external interface specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/interface-spec-doc/) (EIS).
